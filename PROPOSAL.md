# Mars-Invaders(Space-Invaders copycat)



## Description and Motivation:

- Welcome to our version of the famously known as space invaders. However, our game takes place on Mars! You will play as the last surviving ship during the battle on Mars against the evil forces of the Mars invaders!
- Our motivation for this project to show our passion for games as well as our passion towards software development. We wanted to create a game that brings the player back to the classic style of gaming with our own twist on the product!

## Pior Art:

- We took inspiration from a list of Javascript projects that we can both show off our JS skills. We also found that space invaders would be a great project of applying our fundamentals of JS as well as DOM Manipulations. We also found that this style of project would be great on expressing the information of JS that we both have knowledge of.


## Core User WorkFlow:
- The user will be met with the title screen of Mars invaders and a start menu to begin the game.
- The user will be lanuched into a game showing the player's ship and their health bar.
- The user will be shown the evil forces of the invaders as their appearance will be randomly. 
- The user will also be revealed their score increase as they blast the enemies. 
- The user will also hear the sounds of the laser and explosions of both the ship and the enemy ship.
